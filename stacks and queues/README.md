# Stack

> Stack is LIFO â€” *Last In First Out*

*Peeking* is the last added element of the stack.

# Queue

The *peek* function looks at the first item without popping if from the queue as opposed to the stack.

* Addition to the queue is called *enqueing*
* Deletion from the queue is called *dequeuing*
